/*
** Details:
**
** The %_data table managed by this module,
**
**     CREATE TABLE %_data(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, block BLOB);
**
** , contains the following 5 types of records. See the comments surrounding
** the FTS5_*_ROWID macros below for a description of how %_data rowids are 
** assigned to each fo them.
**
** 1. Structure Records:
**
**   The set of segments that make up an index - the index structure - are
**   recorded in a single record within the %_data table. The record consists
**   of a single 32-bit configuration cookie value followed by a list of 
**   SQLite varints. If the FTS table features more than one index (because
**   there are one or more prefix indexes), it is guaranteed that all share
**   the same cookie value.
**
**   Immediately following the configuration cookie, the record begins with
**   three varints:
**
**     + number of levels,
**     + total number of segments on all levels,
**     + value of write counter.
**
**   Then, for each level from 0 to nMax:
**
**     + number of input segments in ongoing merge.
**     + total number of segments in level.
**     + for each segment from oldest to newest:
**         + segment id (always > 0)
**         + first leaf page number (often 1, always greater than 0)
**         + final leaf page number
**
** 2. The Averages Record:
**
**   A single record within the %_data table. The data is a list of varints.
**   The first value is the number of rows in the index. Then, for each column
**   from left to right, the total number of tokens in the column for all
**   rows of the table.
**
** 3. Segment leaves:
**
**   TERM/DOCLIST FORMAT:
**
**     Most of each segment leaf is taken up by term/doclist data. The 
**     general format of term/doclist, starting with the first term
**     on the leaf page, is:
**
**         varint : size of first term
**         blob:    first term data
**         doclist: first doclist
**         zero-or-more {
**           varint:  number of bytes in common with previous term
**           varint:  number of bytes of new term data (nNew)
**           blob:    nNew bytes of new term data
**           doclist: next doclist
**         }
